title: "VPC Configurations"
---

When you [install a Rack](/docs/installing-a-rack/), most of the AWS resources used by Convox are launched inside of a new [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html). That default behavior might not be sufficient in all cases, so we've covered a few of the common non-default VPC configurations below.

1. [Installing into an existing VPC](#installing-into-an-existing-vpc)
1. [Installing a private Rack into an existing VPC](#installing-a-private-rack-into-an-existing-vpc)
1. [Peering VPCs in the same region](#peering-vpcs-in-the-same-region)

## Installing into an existing VPC

By default, Convox Rack installations create a new VPC with subnets in two or three (when available) Availability Zones in your chosen AWS Region. If you'd like to install a Convox Rack into an existing VPC, we recommend allocating a /24 block subnet in each of three Availability Zones.

To install a Rack into an existing VPC, you'll need to provide:

* the VPC ID
* the VPC CIDR
* the CIDRs of the subnets into which Convox should be installed
* the Internet Gateway ID

Also, make sure about your existing VPC:

* Internet Gateway is attached
* `DNS resolution` and `DNS hostnames` options are enabled

The [advanced Rack installer](/docs/advanced-installer-options) in Convox Console will help you choose these values.

### Choosing suitable CIDR blocks

Your existing VPC has a CIDR block, and each of your existing subnets has its own CIDR block within that larger VPC block. From the remaining addresses in your VPC CIDR block, you'll need to create an additional subnet in each Availability Zone in which you'd like to run Convox instances. Convox recommends three subnets with /24 CIDR blocks to give your Convox installation 254 addresses per subnet.

## Installing a private Rack into an existing VPC

Installing a private Rack into an existing VPC requires specifying a few more options in the **Advanced Network and Compute Options** section of the Convox web installer:

- In the **Use an existing VPC** field, select the AWS region where your existing VPC is located, as well as the corresponding **existing Internet Gateway**.
- Provide the **Subnet CIDRs** for three public subnets, e.g. `10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.0/24,10.0.3.0/24`.
- Check the **Private** checkbox.
- Provide the **Private CIDRs** for three private subnets, e.g. `10.0.4.0/24,10.0.5.0/24,10.0.6.0/24`.

## Peering VPCs

An alternative to installing a Convox Rack into an existing VPC is to install the Rack into its own isolated VPC and then peer that VPC with another containing your non-Convox infrastructure.

> A VPC peering connection allows you to route traffic between the peer VPCs using private IP addresses; as if they are part of the same network.

 The above excerpt comes from the AWS [Peering Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/Welcome.html), a great place to learn more about this technique.

If you are ready to set up a peering connection between two VPCs, the [Working with VPC Peering Connections](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/working-with-vpc-peering.html) section of that guide walks you through the steps, which include the following and more:

* Creating a VPC Peering Connection
* Accepting a VPC Peering Connection
* Updating Route Tables for Your VPC Peering Connection
* Updating Your Security Groups to Reference Peered VPC Security Groups

Keep in mind that VPC Peering has a number of [limitations](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/vpc-peering-overview.html#vpc-peering-limitations) that can complicate its setup. For example, you cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks.
