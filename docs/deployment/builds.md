When you deploy or build your application a "build" artifact is created. This consists of the Docker images that make up your application plus metadata stored in your Rack's database. Each build has a unique ID and is associated with one or more [releases](/docs/releases).

## Creating a Build

You can simply build your application by running `convox build` from the top-level directory:

```
$ convox build
```

When you run this command the following steps are executed:

- The Convox CLI builds a tarball from all the files in your project (except the ones specified in `.dockerignore`)
- The CLI uploads the tarball to your Rack
- The Rack extracts the tarball and reads `convox.yml`
- Docker images are built or pulled as specified by `convox.yml`
- The images are tagged and pushed into your Rack's private Amazon ECR registry
- Build metadata is saved to the Rack
- A new [release](/docs/releases) is created from the build and its metadata is saved too

The newly created release will not be promoted (made active) until you run `convox releases promote <release ID>`.

If you'd like to build your app and promote the release in a single step, you can run `convox deploy` rather than `convox build`.

### Building From a Git Repository

You can tell Convox to build from a remote git repository rather than shipping your local files. To do so, pass the URL (with the .git extension) as an argument to `convox build`. For example:

```
$ convox build https://github.com/myuser/myproject.git
```

## Inspecting Builds

Run `convox builds` to see a list of builds for your application.

Run `convox builds info <build ID>` to view metadata for a particular build.

Run `convox builds logs <build ID>` to view the logs for a particular build.

## Moving Builds

It's possible to export a build from one app and import it to another app, even if the apps are on different Racks.

To move a build, first export it:

```
$ convox builds export <build ID> -a <appname> > build.tgz
```

You can then import the build into another app, even on a different Rack:

```
convox builds import -a <appname> < build.tgz
```

You can even pipe these commands together directly:

```
$ convox builds export <build ID> -a <app1> -r <rack1> | convox builds import -a <app2> -r <rack2>
```

## Build arguments

Convox respects the `ARG` Dockerfile directive. For more information, see [Dockerfile: ARG](/docs/dockerfile/#arg).
